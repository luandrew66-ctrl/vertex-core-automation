# Vertex Automation | Residential Systems Research
**Author:** Founder & Systems Architect  
**Location:** Richmond Hill, Ontario  

## Project Overview
This repository serves as the central Research & Development hub for **Vertex Automation**. The goal of this project is to analyze and solve systemic inefficiencies in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) residential real estate market through custom Python-based automation.

## Current R&D Focus
* **CRM Data Flow:** Mapping API endpoints for common real estate CRM platforms.
* **Friction Analysis:** Measuring the "time-cost" of manual lead entry vs. automated intake.
* **Latency Optimization:** Scripting high-speed handlers for webhook-based lead triggers.
